-Why?
Previously, pushing requested changes to Cascade was a 15 minute process between bin/build,uploading the _assets.zip, publishing the extracted assets and pages, etc...

The idea here is to use the provided Cascade-Assets.xml block once per story, and use the commandline to push changes. To start, this is only on dev-WWW, but we'd like to eventually use it on production. 

-How?
    This relies on the following files:
        -config/environments/netlify.rb 
        -app/views/layouts/netlify.html.erb
        -lib/tasks/build.rake
        -dist/netlify

    1) Netlify (https://app.netlify.com/sites/chapman/overview) automatically builds the changes in dist/netlify for each branch push.
    2) https://chapman.netlify.app/ is the base URL. Individual branches are available at https://branch-name--chapman.netlify.app/
    3) Development branch is set as Netlify's "production" branch.
